    <h1>Tirumalasri Vedam</h1>

    <p>I am a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. </p>
	<p>My website, like a lot of things in my life at the moment, is a work in progress. </p>
<p>While I add to it and try to make it look like it isnâ€™t propped up by two twigs and a match, I offer you my <a href="https://tirumalasrivedam.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a> and a lyric that's been on my mind today.</p>

<p class="lyric"><em>"I heard you like magic,<br>
        I've got a wand and a rabbit."</em></p>
