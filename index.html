    <h1>Tirumalasri Vedam</h1>

    <p>I am a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. </p>
	<p>My website, like a lot of things in my life at the moment, is a work in progress. </p>
<p>While I add to it and try to make it look like it isnâ€™t propped up by two twigs and a match, I offer you a lyric that's been on my mind lately. </p>

<p class="lyric"><em>"There's a part of you always standing by,<br>
Mapping out the sky,<br>
Finishing a hat.<br>
Starting on a hat,<br>
Finishing a hat...<br>
Look, I made a hat...<br>
Where there never was a hat."</em></p>
